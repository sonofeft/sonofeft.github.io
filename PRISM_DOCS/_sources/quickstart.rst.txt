QuickStart
==========

Install 32 bit Python 2.7
-------------------------

At the time of this writing, python 2.7.15 is the latest version of `python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
PRISM does not currently support python 3.x, so be sure to use a 32 bit 2.7 environment.

There are many FORTRAN routines in PRISM that are compiled for use with 32 bit python 2.7.
Those PRISM routines will not work with the 64 bit version of python 2.7 unless they are recompiled.

The Windows installer is **python-2.7.15.msi**, so run it after downloading from `www.python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

.. note::

    Make sure that your PATH environment variable reflects the above install.
    
    It should contain "C:\\Python27"  and  "C:\\Python27\\Scripts"
    
    After the install, open a new Command Prompt window and simply type, PATH, to
    see what your PATH environment variable contains.
    
    

Install Python Packages
-----------------------

There are a number of support packages that PRISM requires to run properly.
Python uses the **pip** installer to get these packages directly from the `PyPi repository <https://pypi.org/>`_.
The following commands will install the required packages::

    pip install future
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install scipy
    pip install pywin32
    pip install configparser

.. note::

    There are several **All-In-One** scientific python distributions that have the above packages pre-installed.
    You may prefer these to installing individual packages.
    
    `WinPython - Python-based scientific environment <https://winpython.github.io>`_
    
    `Python(x,y) - the scientific Python distribution <https://python-xy.github.io>`_
    
    `Anaconda (Python distribution) <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ (note that Anaconda
    does not store its python files at C:\\Python27)

Install PRISM
-------------

The easiest way to install PRISM is to run the EXE install program.
PRISM version 1.1.12, for example, would be::

    prism-1.1.12.win32.exe
    
This can be done by `double clicking` the file in `File Explorer` or giving the above command in
a Command Prompt Window.

For help with the command prompt, see: `<https://www.wikihow.com/Open-the-Command-Prompt-in-Windows>`_.

Install Support Software
------------------------

PRISM makes use of several support codes. Two commercial programs (Refprop and TDK) as well as one open source program (POV-Ray).

Refprop can be obtained from `<www.nist.gov/srd/refprop>`_

POV-Ray can be downloaded from `<http://povray.org/>`_, however, an EXE install file should have come with the rest of the PRISM files::

    povwin-3.7-agpl3-setup.exe

Contact your software administrator to obtain a copy of TDK.

.. note::

    TDK is restricted by U.S. export control regulations

When you run PRISM the first time, you will see the reminder text below
that gives information about the required installs.::
            
    for full functionality,
    Refprop, TDK and POV-Ray must be installed
    
    Refprop is a Commercial Program
    Buy Refprop at: www.nist.gov/srd/refprop
    
    TDK is a Commercial Program
    Get TDK from your software administrator
    NOTE: TDK is restricted by U.S. export control regulations
    
    POV-Ray is an open source ray-tracing program
    for installation instructions see: http://povray.org/
    
    type "prism_setup" in a  "Command Prompt" window
    to help PRISM locate the above codes on your computer
                
    CURRENT LOCATIONS:
    TDK: unknown
    RefProp: unknown
    POV-Ray: unknown

.. note::

    type **prism_setup** at the command prompt to set up the locations for Refprop, TDK and POV-Ray

Getting Help
------------

After installing PRISM, there will be a launch command line program called **prism** and/or, **prism.exe**. 

From a terminal or command prompt window simply type::

    prism

Your browser will launch with these PRISM help pages.

Running PRISM
-------------

There are a large number of examples included in this document from the more simple
:ref:`Building Blocks <building_blocks_link>` examples to more complex :ref:`System Models <many_examples_link>`.

For instance, look at :ref:`Example_1 <example_1_link>` on the :ref:`Many Examples <many_examples_link>` page. 

Click on the Source File:`example_1.py <./_static/colorized_massitems/example_1.html>`_ link to view the source code for that example.

Highlight the source code with your mouse, right click the highlighted code and select **Copy**. 

Paste that code into your text editor and save it to a python file.(for example D:/prism/example_1.py).

At a command prompt, navigate to that subdirectory (D:/prism in the example above) and give the command::

    python.exe example1.py

You should see POV-Ray launch and create an image with 3 tanks and output to the command prompt something like the following.::

    D:\prism>python.exe example_1.py
    Config File: C:\Users\Charlie\PRISM.cfg
    Refprop dll_path = C:/RefProp8/
    adding fluid Helium.fld
     scriptName: example_1.py
     scriptPath: D:\prism\example_1.py
     newDirPath: D:\prism\example_1\
    POVFileName: D:\prism\EXAMPL~1\example_1.pov
      HTML file: D:\prism\example_1.htm

Running **example_1.py** will create an output file called **example1.htm** and a subdirectory called **example_1**

.. image:: _static/example1_dir_create.jpg

Double clicking the **example_1.htm** file will launch your browser and display the analysis results. 
The images below are taken from that HTML page.

.. image:: _static/example_1_render_front_0_1.png
    :width: 45%
.. image:: _static/example_1_1___sysMass_vs_PHe.png
    :width: 45%
    


The subdirectory **example_1**, contains a number of images and data files created by the analysis. 
The above two images as well as the data used to create the plot in a CSV file (Excel can open it).
Also included are the files used by POV-Ray to create the scaled 3D rendering of the tanks.

The purpose of the POV-Ray renderings is to show scale and general layout, not detailed component drawings.

PRISM Error Messages
--------------------

numpy upgrade
-------------

A possible error message that PRISM may issue is in regards to the version of **numpy** included in your python installation.
An error message something like::

    module compiled against API version 0xc but this version of numpy is 0x9
    
means that your version of **numpy** needs to be upgraded.

At a command prompt, give the following command to upgrade your version of **numpy**::

    pip install numpy --upgrade
