Philosophy
==========

The philosophy of PRISM is to aide the user in understanding math models.

Similar to high-end systems such as `ModelCenter<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelCenter>`_,
PRISM aids in the design and optimization of systems. 
PRISM enables easy optimization, sensitivity study, and visualization. 
The math model can be as big or as small as desired.

PRISM's origins are in the aerospace, rocket propulsion industry and was created to aide in the understanding of
those types of models.
